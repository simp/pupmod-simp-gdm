- Added pam access entry for gdm user so greeter session can start.
- Added error message if gdm version older than 3.0 is used.
- Added the following parameters:
    gdm::pam  - indicates if pam is controlled by simp.  If this is set to
                true then a pam access rule is added to allow the gdm user
                local access to the system. Defaults to simp_options::pam.
    gdm::display_mgr_user  - the name of the user that the gdm service will run under.

- simp/gnome and simp/auditd were removed from the dependencies
  in metadata.json.
- simp/pam was added to optional dependencies and is needed if gdm:pam
  is set to true.
- removed pulseaudio from list of packages because gdm has dependency  on it
  so it will automatically be installed.
